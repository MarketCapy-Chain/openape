# No bullshit NFT
Mint an individual NFT or a collection without the extra platform bullshit.

This tool lets anyone deploy an ERC 721 smart contract sourced from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721PresetMinterPauserAutoId). The contract is modified to allow a bidding system as seen on marketplaces like Rarible.

The goal is to make this project the NFT ecosystem's go-to tool for generic tasks like deploying an NFT smart contract, and so on.
All open source contributions are appreciated. The project is in its infancy. Find me at [@MonkeyMeaning](https://twitter.com/MonkeyMeaning) on Twitter to chat about the project.

## Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
